The mission was co-sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) performed preliminary processing of SRTM data and forwarded  it to the NGA for further processing and distribution.  The raster image hosted by this service was generated using ArcGIS tools to convert DEM data for the state of California into a raster image.  The results were reprojected into World Mercator (WKID: 54004) for display purposes.  Pixel size is approximately 90 meters and vertical units are defined in meters.
